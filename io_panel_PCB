                                          -------
        Current through Q_E                 8.1 mA

Conclusions
-----------
1)  Though the LEDs glow a little, when the corresponding 7seg element is
    on, it doesn't add much to the current drawn.

2)  It's save to power all 3 LEDs at the same time, as the combined output
    current by far doesn't excess the 50mA through VCC or GND rating.
    The single output currents are also far below the specified 20mA maximum
    output clamp current.

3)  Powering all 8 7seg elements at the same time is a little risky, as the
    combined current would be around 65mA, which is above the maximum rating
    of current through VCC or GND.
    When continuously cycling through LEDs, KEYs, DIS0 and DIS1, the maximum
    rating would only be excessed < 50% of the time, so we don't need to worry
    too much. (Test pending)
